# Statistical Analysis Tests for Disease Diagnostics

Modern technologies and new devices are present in the doctor's office. Those are used to facilitate the appointment and the diagnosis increasing the assurance level of the diagnosis. One of the biggest issues are the misdiagnosis and the wrong relationship between the symptom and disease. 

The dataset is the new health analysis dataset proposed by Tchango et al. It includes age, the differential of predicted diseases, sex of the patient, the pathology that was diagnosed by the doctor after differential analyzes, symptoms of the patient and precedents. The dataset relies on a medical knowledge base (KB), a compilation of about 20000 medical papers. The information that was extracted were incidence, prevalence, symptoms, and risk factorsâ€™ likelihood ratios. After that, all documents were reviewed by several doctors to ensure that those diseases descriptions did not include atypical presentations. DDXPlus  is composed of 49 different diseases, 113 initial symptoms, 110 symptoms and 1.300.000 patient symptoms and predictions of diseases. 

The project aims to analyze specific diseases that were diagnosed and through statistical methods extract the measurements relationship between symptoms and diseases and the efficacy of the technique on predicting them.
