# Impact of Modified Daily Activities on Sleep Quality in Adults > 60 

Numerous academic projects and papers proposed to investigate the effect of age on sleep duration. Those have proven that as individuals age, their ability to maintain consistent sleep decreases. According to three meta-analysis reviews, age was linearly associated with decreased total sleep time, with an approximate decline of 10- 12 minutes per decade in the adult population. This trend tends to plateau after the age of 60, as found in the study by Li et al.  

Espirituâ€™s research not only proves the connection between sleep deprivation and aging but also highlights other causes of this issue. Factors including medical conditions, social and lifestyle changes contribute to sleep problems in older adults. 

Yang et al and Kredlow et al research demonstrates that their paper that sedentary behavior is another factor significantly contributes to insomnia and sleep disturbance. Their study also shows that exercise-based intervention has an acute positive impact on many important metrics of sleep improving the quality of sleep of many patients. 

This project examines the influence of exercises on the sleep patterns of a sedentary group of individuals aged 60 and older. The data is collected from using accelerometers which are used to monitor parameters such as sedentary time, uprightness, ambulation and sleep.
